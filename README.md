This project implements an end-to-end workflow for the electrical characterization of brushed DC motors rated at or below 12 V, with emphasis on parameters critical to control and power electronics design. The system measures the motor’s armature inductance and electrical time constant using a controlled excitation and transient response analysis. LTspice is used to model the motor and sensing circuitry, while custom analog front-end hardware conditions the signals for acquisition by an ESP32 microcontroller. Embedded firmware handles data capture and timing, enabling accurate parameter extraction for use in motor control algorithms, current-loop design, and simulation-to-hardware validation.
